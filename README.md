# JSLab4QuizApp
Uses a JSON file to build a quiz


Assignment 4–Quiz App

Part 1
Use the data in the file “GeographyQuiz.json” to construct the web page shown below. The style doesn’t have to be the same as shown, but it has to be nice.

Part 2
Refactor the code from Part 1 so that only one question at a time is visible to the user, and navigation buttons –to go to the next or previous question –are shown at the bottom of the page. Also, add a “Submit” button after the last question.Note that the “Previous” button is disabled for Question 1, and the “Next” button is disabled for Question 10.

Part 3
When the “Submit” button is pressed:
If the user has not answered all of the questions, display a warning and ask whether the submission should proceed. 
If the user has answered all of the questions, display a results page. 
Results Page
The results page should show all of the questions. For each question, indicate the user’s answer and the correct answer in visually different ways (both ways if the user’s answer is correct). Finally, show the user’s score at the end.

Part 4
Test your application with another quiz file to make sure everything works as expected.
